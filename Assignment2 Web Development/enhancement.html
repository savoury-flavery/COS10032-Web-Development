<h2>The Enhancements Used</h2>
<p>There have been 4 main Enhancements implemented in this website: <br>
<a href="#menubut">Menu Buttons</a><br>
<a href="#embvid">Embedded Youtube Video</a><br>
<a href="#anchp">Anchor Points</a><br>
<a href="#qtime">Quiz Timer</a><br>
</p>
</fieldset>

<br>

<fieldset>
<h2 id="menubut">Menu Buttons</h2>
<p>The menu buttons are located at the top of each page. There you have Home, Information, Quiz Page, Enhancements and References. <br>
These buttons were made using both the form and button elements. 
By putting them together you have a functioning button that sends the user back to the linked action page.
<br><br>
This enhancement also uses css in the form of the .menu_button class being a hoverable. When it is hovered over it will gain a background color and the font color will change.
It uses color, background color, and opacity to make it stand out with border radius giving it curved edges to give it a classic button feel.
<br><br>
Also implemented in this enhancement are the changes of color to links. As links have a set color for its four states, there has been css added to change these colors to ensure that the links match the websites theme.

<a href="https://mercury.swin.edu.au/cos10032/s104416957/ass01/index.html">Back to Home Page</a>
<p>The youtube video has been embedded in the website using an a hfref link. The video is represented by a youtube logo png.

<h2 id="anchp">Anchor Point</h2>
<a href="https://mercury.swin.edu.au/cos10032/s104416957/ass01/topic.html">Back to Information Page</a>
<p>The anchor point was implemented using the id= tag on the h1 element. When the user gets to the bottom of the page they will see
the link, which is another href link being used. Once that link is clicked it will take the user back to the top of the page starting 
at where the h1 element is located. <br><br>
This enhancement is also featured at both the top and bottom of this page.</p>

<h2 id="qtime">Quiz Page Timer</h2>
<a href="https://mercury.swin.edu.au/cos10032/s104416957/ass01/quiz.html">Back to Quiz Page</a>
<p>	Located at the bottom on the quiz page is an enhancement that was implement to work as a
100 second quiz timer.

This timer works using solely keyframe animation elements. The code goes from 0% to 100%, while counting down 100 seconds to 0 seconds.
The animation is set on a 100second linear timer so that way through every percent it counts down exactly 1 second.
<br><br>
As the timer goes down the color of the animation shifts. It originally begins as a light purple, but as it counts down it gradually shifts 
to a light red. Once the counter gets to 80% or 20 seconds remaining it starts to shift into a more vibrant shade of red to signal that the timer is almost up.
Once the 100 seconds pass the timer stops at 0.
<br><br>
This timer does not reset unless the page is refreshed, and is mainly used as a fun side game for the user while answering the quiz.
